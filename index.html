    <img src="./OIP (1).jpg" alt=""><p>Kulfi  is a frozen dairy dessert of the Indian subcontinent. It is often described as "traditional Indian ice cream".Kulfi originated in 16th-century Delhi during the Mughal era. It is part of the national cuisines of India, Pakistan, and Trinidad and Tobago.[citation needed] It is also popular in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Middle East.[4][better source needed]
        Kulfi is denser and creamier than regular ice cream. It comes in various flavours. Traditional ones include cream (malai), rose, mango, cardamom (elaichi), saffron (kesar or zafran), and pistachio.[better source needed] Newer flavours may include apple, orange, strawberry, peanut, or avocado.[better source needed] Unlike ice cream, kulfi is not whipped, which results in a solid, dense dessert similar to frozen custard. Thus, it is sometimes considered a distinct category of frozen dairy-based dessert.The density of kulfi causes it to melt more slowly than ice cream.</p></div>
